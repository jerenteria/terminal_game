# Terminal typing game that gives you your words per minute!
# Game was built in Python3 and with the help of the curses import
# Curses is a library that allows you manipulate the way your terminal looks on your computer. This is how i got the words to change from green to red whenever someone messed up a character

# If you are new to curses you should check out this very helpful doc https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.1?topic=library-initializing-curses
